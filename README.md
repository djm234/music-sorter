# music-sorter
A tool that enables sorting a collection of random music files into a more structured form.

Given a directory of music files (such as MP3, WAV, WMA, MP4, M4A), this tool will scan that directory, extract relevant tag data, and attempt to standardise the artist names according to a reference database of artist names.

The tool then creates a backup of these files into another directory that follows a more structured format: `artist/album/title`.
